# SOC Task 2 – Log Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of the **Future Interns Cyber Security Internship** program.  
The task involved analyzing **SOC logs** to detect malicious activities, identify compromised accounts, and recommend security improvements.  

## 🛠️ Task Breakdown
- Analyzed raw log files (`SOC_Task2_Sample_Logs.txt`)
- Identified suspicious logins, malware detections, and file access attempts
- Correlated user activity with IP addresses
- Generated a security report with findings and recommendations

##  Tools
- `SOC_Task2_Sample_Logs.txt` → Sample logs provided
- Splunk (Free-Trial)


## 🚨 Key Findings
- Multiple **malware infections** detected (Trojan, Rootkit, Ransomware, Spyware, Worms)
- Suspicious IPs (`198.51.100.42`, `203.0.113.77`) repeatedly associated with threats
- Compromised user accounts (Alice, Bob, Eve)
- Evidence of possible lateral movement across networks

## ✅ Recommendations
- Enforce **MFA**
- Deploy **IDS/IPS**
- Improve **endpoint security**
- Conduct **user awareness training**
